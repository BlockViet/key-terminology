# Key Terminology

- Authentication:
  The process of proving the counterparty identities and the existence of assets via private/public keys.
- Blockchain:
  A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of transaction records with various protections against tampering and revision.
- Consensus mechanism:
  A method to authenticate and validate a set of values or a transaction without the need to trust or rely on a centralized authority; can be constructed on and off a blockchain; a variety of approaches exist.
- Cryptography: 
  The process of enforcing the authentication and cryptographic validation of transaction integrity via quorum structures and confirmation via code without the need to trust or rely on a centralized authority.
- Cryptographic signature:
  A method to mathematically validate the owner of a piece of data beyond any doubt if the user has kept the private key to sign the transaction safe.
- Delegated proof-of-stake:
  Delegated proof-of-stake stakeholders elect “witnesses,” responsible for ordering and committing transactions, and “delegates,” responsible for coordinating software updates and parameter changes.
- Distributed ledger:
  A digital record of ownership that differs from traditional database technology, since there is no central administrator or central data storage; instead, the ledger is replicated among many different nodes in a peer-to-peer network virtual private network, and each transaction is uniquely signed with a private key.
- Fault Tolerance: 
  The property that enables a system to continue operating properly even if some of its components fail.
- Federated consensus:
  A way to achieve Byzantine agreement (consensus), in which nodes can share another node and reach consensus without directly knowing all other nodes.
- Governance:
  The establishment of a decentralized control—no central authority command whose approval is required for reaching consensus; some types of consensus mechanism use an elected leader who leads the validation and maintains the data which is been shared among the nodes. The governance aspect also includes the onboarding and offboarding of nodes within a permissioned network.
- Hash functions:
  An application programming interface creates, through a process called hashing, a unique key or digital fingerprint for each file.
- Hierarchical deterministic keys:
  A deterministic wallet is a system of deriving keys from a single starting point known as a seed. The seed allows a user to easily backup and restore a wallet without needing any other information and can, in some cases, allow the creation of public addresses without the knowledge of the private key.
- Interledger protocol:
  Connects legacy ledgers of the past with the distributed ledgers of the future.
- Leader-based consensus:
  A type of consensus in which a leader is elected and stays in control until a vote decides on a new leader. In this model, it is the leader who validates transactions and sends data to the other nodes.
- Liveness:
  Refers to the transmission of data that is happening now and not a replay of a recording of data sent previously. Liveness is introduced into secure transmissions by mixing in a number that cannot be duplicated again. A node enjoys liveness if it can externalize new values without the participation of any failed nodes. Some nodes may fail, and as long as a majority of nodes are available, the network is still able to operate, can deal with latency (one or two slow servers will not impact overall consensus response times), and impact on the network bandwidth of everlarger ledgers being distributed also has to be considered.
- Merkle tree multi-signature:
  An authentication function that allows a group of users to sign a single document with more than one private key.
- Node:
  Members or systems of a consensus network; a server that holds a replicated copy of the ledger; can have varying roles: to issue, verify, receive, inform, etc. For all intents and purposes, a node can be a VM instance.
- Node-to-Node (N2N):
  A mechanism in which only two nodes involved in a transaction take part; in effect, it eschews traditional consensus mechanism.
- Nonce number:
  A unique identifier used to get into a network just once.
- Permissioned: 
  A private network in which users set rules about access, the consensus mechanism, governance, participation etc.
- Practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT):
  A characteristic of a distributed computing system allowing for a certain amount of failures yet allows that system to continue operating and reach agreement. The traditional Byzantine consensus protocols today play a role in proof-of-concept settings where all nodes are known to each other (permissioned system, and authenticated and trusted validators within the network are chosen at random but always at a majority, which is resilient to Byzantine imposters and Sybil attacks.
- Public blockchain:
  A network in which anyone can participate by reading data, submitting transactions, and participating in the validation process.
- Public key:
  the public address where other wallets send transaction values
- Private key:
  An encryption key uniquely linked to the owner and known only to the parties exchanged in a transaction; it is secretly held in a digital wallet.
- Privacy:
  Ensuring that only the receiver intended can read the message. The field of computing cryptography addresses many security and privacy issues of distributed consensus through the use of mathematical formulas for specific secure communication requirements within the context of any application-to-application communications.
- Proprietary consensus mechanism:
  A consensus model that is unique in nature and may or may not be based off of any existing consensus algorithms.
- Quorum structures:
  The styles and stages used by nodes in a network to exchange messages asserting statements (can technically be differentiated by factors such as (nodes) leader election, types of leaders, the method of validating transactions, fault tolerance levels, utilization of tokens, strictness of algorithm, liveness guarantees, and permissions management)
- Remote procedure call:
  A protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer in a network without having to understand network details, also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call.
- Round-robin:
  A consensus mechanism in which nodes take turns at being the leader.
- Scalability:
  The capability to cope and perform an increasing throughput and maintain or even increase its level of performance or efficiency when tested by larger operational demands. Latency is the delay in transaction processing.
- Security:
  Distributed ledger security is the process for protecting and safeguarding business and personal data, as well as transaction information. The validation of the results should be correct under non-Byzantine failures; also includes integrity (an assurance to the receiving node that a message received has not been altered in any way) and nonrepudiation (a mechanism to prove that the sending node really sent this message). Security can include digital signatures as a feature.
- Sidechain:
  The transfer of assets from one mechanism to a separate “pegged” mechanism; special-purpose ledger.
- Throughput:
  A measure of how many transactions can be processed in a given amount of time.
- Tokenization:
  The process of replacing sensitive data with unique identification symbols that retain all essential information about the data without compromising its security.
